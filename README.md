# BigDataAnalyticsFinal
## Assigned Task

For this project we were assigned to take a data set provided by the Data.Gov "PLACES: County Data (GIS Friendly Format), 2021 release" and create a descriptive report or a predictive algorithm.

## Asthma and Smoking comparison

### Data Cleaning
This project I started by cleaning the information up using my DataCleaning.py file on Data_Gov.csv to rename columns. I also combined the county and the state into a single column and set that column as the index. Outside of the project I renamed the file output of DataOut.csv to cs356_Data.csv. 

### Data Visualization

This project creates a scatter plot comparing the number of smokers with the number of people with asthma.
The data set used for this project was county health records for over 3,000 counties within the United States.
