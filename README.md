# BigDataAnalyticsFinal

This project creates a scatter plot comparing the number of smokers with the number of people with asthma.
The data set used for this project was county health records for over 3,000 counties.

The DataCleaning.py file was used on the Data_Gov.CSV to create the data set for the data visualization file.
